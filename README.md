# simple-genetic-algorithm
Just a simple implementation of a genetic algorithm I made to help me understand them better

Its not really that great, and the variable names are definitely bad. I just wrote it almost as a POC for another project.
In the future I probably wont edit this file but use it as reference if I want to make a more generalized algorithm, or just use a more efficient and robust library
